# INPUTS:
# D, C, B, A, Ctrl1, Ctrl2

# INPUT Vector 1:
# A should be the one that is selected since the control bits are 00
000U00

# INPUT Vector 2:
# B should be the one that is selected since the control bits are 01
11U101

# INPUT Vector 3:
# C should be the one that is selected since the control bits are 10
010010

# INPUT Vector 4:
# D should be the one that is selected since the control bits are 11
011111

# INPUT Vector 5:
# Since one of the control bits is U, the OR gate terminals should have 2 U's and 2 0's 
# since with the other control bit, the AND gate should output 0 half of the time
1111U1
